## Concept
Elemental type games focus on combining elements to form new elements. Some of the games are community based (including this one) where the players of the game can decide which elements to create.

## About/History
Elemental 3 was a game made by carykh where you combined your starting four elements (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water) into many more elements. This ran for some time until it was shut down due to a combination of the high traffic that the poorly programmed code.

This project start off as mine as a small side project, seeing if I could make an elemental game after the success of [Dave's Elemental 4](https://elemental4.net/). Until about September of 2020, this game didn't really get much traffic, until Cary released [a video about his Elemental 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQWwfYSUckY), which presumably got people interesting in elemental-type games.

Because at the time Dave's Elemental 4 was down because of an upcoming remake, this game was one of the only elemental games available on the web, instead of platforms like Android, Roblox, or a executable that you run on your system. This made it highly accessible to many.

Unfortunately, during development, I accidentally deleted the database (of 340 elements) full of the recipes by mistake. With no way to get these back, I decided to fully reset the database. As this was disappointing, this might of been a good thing, as even more players started playing the game, and the database soon grew to the size it was before in almost a day.

On the 21st of September, I temporarily shut down the game for two weeks.
