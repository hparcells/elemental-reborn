Logging in with Google ensures that votes are legitimate, rather than letting anyone suggest anything, This may change with a future update, allowing non-logged in players to play, but not to suggest new elements.

No IP addresses, email addresses, or other identifying information is stored on the server, other than your account associated with the Google account you used to login to play with. That name is used to track who suggested and pioneered elements, and could be displayed to players who want to view more information about an element.
