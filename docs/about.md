The documentation page here is designed to provide useful information to players and developers alike.

## Concept
Elemental type games focus on combining elements to form new elements. Some of the games are community based (including this one) where the players of the game can decide which elements to create.

## Source
The source code for this project and the documentation is available at https://github.com/hparcells/elemental-reborn. Known issues and task boards are also there as well.
